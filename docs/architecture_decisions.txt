The external communication with the system will be the Flask Rest API.
The clients do not need to be modified and the API will play the role of the
orchestrator between microservices.


The UserService communicates with the API via REST. Rest is well known and
easy to use. We can also utilize easy caching on the network layer using the urlpath as key.


LocationService exposes a Grpc interface. We expect a lot incoming location
and we can benefit from the perfomance characteristics of grpc. 
Location write requests are put in a Kafka bus for asynchronous writing to the db.
This way we can keep our database load under control when we have a lot of locations to write.
The writes are performed by the LocationWrited which listens to a kafka topic and consumes messages

The flask app has also a class ConnectionService. In the new design this class is using 
the UserService to fetch user information and the LocationService to fetch
location information.
